<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

We got tasked to solve a business problem for any company. Our team had the opportunity to work for EPI-USE Africa for this project. 
The problem was to solve the transport of confidential documents and personnel during the Covid-19 pandemic. In turn this gave us the opportunity to create DnD.

The business requirements:
* Authentication for login and register for users, admins and drivers.
* Bookings for parcels, documents, and transportation incorporated into a calandar.
* QR system for packages.
* Tracking of packages and completed deliveries and routes.
* Vehicle registration and maintenance schedules.
* Multiple driver schedules.
* Messaging and comment system to communicate with drivers and other personnel.
* Mobile and Web friendly.
* Reporting on parcels and documents delivered. Transportation, vehicle, driver and system usage statistics.
